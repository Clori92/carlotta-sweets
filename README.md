# Carlotta-Sweets React project

Carlotta Sweets was my home food business that I created during Covid to be able to sell my cake, fast forward to now, I had some fun with this task and recreated this website by myself instead of using a template :)\
In this project, we are going to navigate through a web page using the Routing system in React.js\
Within the webpage you can go through different pages using the navigation bar at the top of the page.\
Routing is very important because we are able to switch pages without making the page refresh, adding React.js hooks can make the user's life easier.

## Must-haves

To be able to run and see this project you should download all the content and while inside the folder you should install the node_modules back with the:
### `npm install`

After doing that you should be able to run the React application with
### `npm start`

When everything is done you should be about to see the Home page!

Have fun and enjoy :)
